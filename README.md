# ðŸ§¬ How Do We Assemble Genomes?
This repository contains the presentation and accompanying code exploring genome assembly algorithms, as discussed in the [Bioinformatics Algorithms book](https://www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/) by Phillip Compeau and Pavel Pevzner. The presentation was created as part of the course "Bioinformatics" at the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, University of Banja Luka.

**Course:** Bioinformatics

**Topics covered:**
* Genome assembly challenges
* Overlap-Layout-Consensus approach
* De Bruijn graphs for assembly
* Practical examples and implementations

**Presentation (in Serbian):** `presentation/asembliranje_genoma.pdf`

**Code:** `code/genome_assembly.ipynb`

**Presentation template credit:** The presentation was created using a modified version of the [MATF presentation template by Nikola Ajzenhamer](https://github.com/ajzenhamernikola/matf-presentation-template/tree/master)
